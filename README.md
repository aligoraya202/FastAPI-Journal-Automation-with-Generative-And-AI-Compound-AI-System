Overview
- This repository hosts a compact, production-ready automation system for journals. It uses a compound AI approach to orchestrate multiple AI agents, each handling a slice of the pipeline: from metadata intake and enrichment to writing, formatting, and publication readiness.
- The system is built on FastAPI, a lean Python framework that provides clean RESTful APIs, strong typing, and fast performance.
- The AI stack blends Google Gemini for semantic understanding, Groq’s LLaMA for generation, and the CORE API for retrieval-augmented generation and knowledge sourcing.
- Outputs can be structured JSON, LaTeX-ready content, Markdown manuscripts, and publication-ready PDFs. The design supports RAG workflows to pull relevant literature and ensure factual grounding.

Key Concepts
- Compound AI System: A coordinated set of AI agents that work in sequence or parallel to complete a task. Each agent focuses on a subtask — metadata normalization, outline generation, content drafting, citation management, and QA.
- Agent Orchestration: A lightweight director pattern that assigns tasks to specialized agents. It ensures data provenance, versioning, and auditable changes through the pipeline.
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): The system pulls external sources (via CORE) to ground generated content in credible literature. This reduces hallucinations and improves accuracy.
- Metadata-First Pipeline: The process starts with metadata input (title, keywords, authors, abstracts) and grows into a fully structured article with sections, figures, tables, references, and appendices.
- Output Flexibility: The pipeline can emit JSON schemas, LaTeX sources, Markdown manuscripts, and export-ready PDFs, enabling seamless integration with publishers and repositories.

Features
- End-to-end journal automation: intake, enrichment, drafting, formatting, and export.
- AI collaboration: Gemini for understanding, Groq LLaMA for generation, CORE for sources.
- Structured outputs: JSON payloads, LaTeX sources, Markdown manuscripts, and PDF exports.
- LaTeX-ready pipelines: ready-to-compile templates and bibliography management.
- RAG-enabled literature integration: pull citations and snippets from trusted sources.
- Fine-grained control: adjustable generation temperature, max tokens, and agent budgets.
- Versioned outputs: deterministic seeds and content versioning for reproducibility.
- Authentication-friendly API: token-based access suitable for internal tooling.
- Extensible architecture: plug in new AI agents or data sources with minimal changes.
- Local and cloud-ready deployments: Docker, Kubernetes, or raw Python environments.

Tech Stack
- Language: Python
- Web framework: FastAPI
- AI components: Google Gemini, Groq LLaMA
- Knowledge source: CORE API
- Data formats: JSON, Markdown, LaTeX, PDF

Architecture & Data Flow
- Ingest: Users submit metadata and preferences via a REST API.

- Enrich: The system calls Gemini to interpret intent, extract key questions, and shape the article outline.
- Generate: LLaMA-based generators draft sections, figures, and captions under policy controls.
- Source: CORE fetches relevant literature; results are ranked and injected into the draft through a RAG loop.
- Assemble: The pipeline composes a complete manuscript, with bibliographic references, figures, and appendices.
- Output: The final artifacts are serialized to JSON, LaTeX, Markdown, and PDF.
- Audit: Every step is logged, with data lineage preserved for reproducibility and compliance.
